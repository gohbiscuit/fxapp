## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to have the FX Spot application use React and written in Typescript instead of JavaScript.

The focus is on the source code. We do not expect you to change or improve the ui design. 
We also do not want the functionality to change unless you find something to improve.

### Requirements

1. Create a new React app with Typescript. For instructions, please see https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/#installation.
2. Convert the source to React using Typescript and make use of React and Typescript features to improve the code.
3. Think about a suitable shape for the application state.
4. Find a state solution that *does not* require additional dependencies (Typescript and React only).
5. Extract repeating blocks of TSX (Typescript JSX) into reusable components. 
6. Add tests.
